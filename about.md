**Infinity Loop**는 현재 관심을 가지고 개발 및 테스트하는 과정을 정리하는 공간이다. 때로는 튜토리얼이 될 수도 있고 때로는 샘플 코드가 될 수도 있겠지만, 개발자의 삶 속에서 느끼는 생각들을 정리하는 공간이 되기도 할 것이다.   때로는 회사 생활에 대한 푸념도 있겠지?

**John Doe** is a Senior Art Director from [Vilnius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius), Lithuania. After graduating from The College of Visual Arts with a degree in Communication Design, he worked for three small graphic design shops where he honed his design style and sensibility.
